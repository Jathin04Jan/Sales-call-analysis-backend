  "text": "Thank you for the presentation but I already have a life insurance with another company and I'm happy with my current policy. I understand however it might be worth comparing policies. Ours includes a return of premium rider, an annual gym membership contribution, and coverage for critical illnesses. Could we explore how it might offer better value? We're looking for a partnership not just a transaction. We want devices that truly reflect our brand and provide a unique experience for our guests. We're open to exploring custom branding solutions but we need a payment structure that aligns with our budget. I appreciate your vision and I see the value in creating a bespoke solution that aligns with your brand. Let's explore creative options. We can offer a phased payment plan with milestones tied to the branding development and delivery stages, allowing for flexibility while maintaining a mutually beneficial timeline. Let's stop for a second. How could I have been more focused on your needs in my reply to your concerns? Instead of just stating what you offer you could have focused more on understanding my viewpoint. For example, instead of saying we offer this and that you could have said I am happy that you are happy. However, what aspects of your current insurance plan do you find most lacking or what are your primary concerns about safeguarding your health?",
